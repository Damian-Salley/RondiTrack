# RondiTrack

RondiTrack is a .NET 10 Web API for managing stokvels and their members. The API allows users and stokvels to be created, viewed, updated, and deleted. It also allows users to be added to and removed from stokvels.

## API Design

This project uses Controllers rather than Minimal APIs. Controllers were chosen because RondiTrack has multiple resources and several CRUD and membership endpoints. Controllers help keep these endpoints organised and separated, while Minimal APIs are more suitable for smaller and simpler APIs.

## Domain Rules

### User

A User must follow these rules:
- The ID must be greater than 0.
- First name cannot be empty.
- Last name cannot be empty.
- Email cannot be empty and must contain an `@` symbol.
- Phone number cannot be empty.

These rules are enforced by the User model when a user is created or updated to prevent the User from entering an invalid state.

### Stokvel

A Stokvel must follow these rules:
- The ID must be greater than 0.
- The name cannot be empty.
- The contribution amount must be greater than 0.
- The same User cannot be added to the same Stokvel more than once.

These rules are enforced by the Stokvel model to protect its state and ensure that its membership remains valid.

### Financial Data

`decimal` is used for contribution amounts because it is suitable for financial values and provides more precise decimal arithmetic than floating-point types such as `double`.

## Running the API

1. Make sure the .NET 10 SDK is installed.
2. Open a terminal in the RondiTrack project folder.
3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
4. The terminal will display the local address where the API is running.
5. Open the Scalar API interface in a browser by adding /scalar/v1 to the address.

   for example:
   http://localhost:5274/scalar/v1

The application uses an in-memory data store, so any changes to the data will be reset when the application is restarted.
